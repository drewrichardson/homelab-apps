# Homelab App Manifests (ArgoCD)

GitOps repo for everything ArgoCD deploys onto the [homelab](https://github.com/drewrichardson/homelab)
k3s cluster, kept deliberately separate from that infra-bootstrap repo -- this one changes on a much
faster, less careful cadence (app config, image bumps) than cluster bootstrap does.

## Structure (app-of-apps pattern)
- `bootstrap/app-of-apps.yaml` -- applied **once, manually**, via `kubectl apply -f`. Everything
  after that, ArgoCD manages by watching `apps/` in this same repo.
- `apps/` -- one ArgoCD `Application` per app, each pointing at that app's own directory here.
- `home-assistant/`, `matter-server/` -- the actual Kubernetes manifests per app.

## Apps

### Home Assistant
Migrated from a standalone HAOS install on a Raspberry Pi to the `homeassistant/home-assistant`
container image. Notable choices:
- `hostNetwork: true` -- required for mDNS/SSDP-based local device discovery (HomeKit, Cast, Roomba,
  etc.) to keep working; an isolated pod network can't see that LAN broadcast traffic.
- Pinned to a specific node (`nodeSelector`) on purpose -- with `hostNetwork`, the pod's network
  identity *is* the node's, so letting it float between nodes would change its IP on every
  reschedule.
- `strategy: Recreate`, not the default rolling update -- the pod owns a fixed host port and a
  `ReadWriteOnce` volume, so a rolling update would try to start the replacement before killing the
  original and collide on both.
- Lost with the move off HAOS: the Supervisor and its add-on store. Only two add-ons were in use --
  Matter Server (now its own Deployment here) and Terminal & SSH (not needed; `kubectl exec` covers
  it).

### Matter Server
Standalone `python-matter-server` container replacing the HAOS add-on. Same node as Home Assistant
on purpose (Matter commissioning needs mDNS on the real LAN, and both already require `hostNetwork`).

## Bootstrapping onto a fresh cluster
```
kubectl apply -f bootstrap/app-of-apps.yaml
```
That's the only manual `kubectl apply` this repo ever needs -- ArgoCD takes it from there.
